# <Project Name> BE — Claude Code Config

> Load the relevant SSOT.md section for your task, then AGENTS.md for the rules that apply.
> **Read AGENTS.md's Compliance Status table first**: a section it marks Partial or Not met names
> the shape to follow until the repo catches up.
> Anything that touches the database → AGENTS.md §H before you write the query.

## Project Snapshot

Bun + Hono + `@hono/zod-openapi` + Drizzle ORM on PostgreSQL + Redis (ioredis) + better-auth +
BullMQ (queues) + S3-compatible storage + Sentry + Pino + `<third-party clients>`.

Dev port: `<port>` · API docs: `<docs-path>` · Spec: `<spec-path>`

> If several backends share one rule document and its numbering, say so here. Rule numbers that
> are cited across repos are never renumbered locally, only appended.

## Agent Tooling

- Code navigation: Serena's symbol tools (`find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`) before
  reading whole files. In a multi-repo workspace, scope every search with `relative_path`
  (`.claude/SERENA-WORKSPACE.md`).
- Library APIs: check current docs through Context7 before relying on training data.
- Rarely used MCP servers are not in `.mcp.json`; load one for a session with
  `claude --mcp-config .claude/mcp/<name>.json`.

## Command Wrapper

If you route terminal commands through a wrapper (an output filter, a sandbox, a recorder),
declare it here as a hard rule, prefix every command in this file with it, and list it under
`commandWrappers` in `.claude/agent-config.json` so the safety hook judges the command it wraps.
Read diffs, check results and scan output unfiltered. With no wrapper, the commands below are
already correct.

---

## Quality Gates

Before calling a task done, run `bash scripts/check/gates.sh`. It runs `scripts/check/gates.list`,
the same list `.husky/pre-commit` runs, and prints each gate's exit code and log. In a shared
checkout, `--paths <your files>` limits format and lint to your own files, and
`bash scripts/check/gates.sh --fix <files>` writes the format.

`bun run build` is not a gate; run it after a structural change and before a PR.

`bun run lint` passes `--type-aware`, which needs the `oxlint-tsgolint` devDependency — that is
what catches a Drizzle query with a missing `await` (§H Rule 37).

`src/env.ts` validates on import and exits, so the unit tier needs the env vars set, but it dials
nothing: `src/test/preload.ts` replaces Postgres, Redis (and the queues on it), the auth library
and every provider SDK for the whole run. Never re-mock those in a test file; steer the controls
it exports (AGENTS.md Rule 7).

If you touched `src/db/schema/`:

```bash
bun run db:generate                    # commit the generated migration in the same PR
bash scripts/check/index-coverage.sh   # every FK column must have an index (§H Rule 32)
```

---

## `.env` Files and Production Writes

The hooks refuse shell reads and writes of `.env*` files, and hold SQL that may write through
`db-prod`. Read a file's keys with `bash scripts/env/show.sh <file>` (secrets masked). Only the
user opens a write, with `! bun unlock env` or `! bun unlock db`; when a task needs one, hand them
that command and never work around a refusal. Details: `docs/unlock.md`.

## Context Loading Strategy

| Task                                   | Read                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Anything at all                        | AGENTS.md §A + Compliance Status       |
| New route / handler / module           | SSOT.md §Architecture + AGENTS.md §B, §C + "How to Add a New Module" |
| **Writing any query, index, or pagination** | **AGENTS.md §H + `.claude/rules/backend/drizzle.md`** |
| Caching, N+1, request budgets, latency | AGENTS.md §H, §I + `.claude/rules/backend/performance.md` |
| Middleware chain, CORS, hardening      | AGENTS.md §I + `.claude/rules/backend/hono.md` |
| Database / schema / migrations         | SSOT.md §Database + AGENTS.md §D + `.claude/rules/backend/drizzle.md` |
| Errors / a new error code              | AGENTS.md §C + `.claude/rules/common/error-codes.md` |
| Tests                                  | AGENTS.md §E + `.claude/rules/backend/testing.md` |
| Auth                                   | `src/lib/auth/auth.ts` (better-auth). `src/db/schema/auth.ts` is CLI-generated — do not hand-edit |
| Reviewing a change                     | `.claude/docs/code-review-checklist.md` + `agents-reviewer` |

## Naming Conventions

| Type              | Convention                    | Example                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Module directory   | kebab-case, singular domain noun | `src/modules/project/`          |
| Module files       | `<module>.<layer>.ts`          | `project.service.ts`, `project.routes.ts` |
| Domain error class | PascalCase + `Error` suffix    | `ProjectNotFoundError`           |
| Zod schema export  | camelCase + `Schema` suffix    | `projectResponseSchema`          |
| Test file          | `__tests__/<unit>.test.ts` beside the source | `__tests__/project.service.test.ts` |
| Index name         | `<table>_<cols>_idx`           | `tasks_project_position_idx`     |

---

## Language Convention

All code, comments, JSDoc, commit messages, and PR descriptions are written in **English**.

---

## Commit Format

```
type: description
```

Types: `feat` · `fix` · `refactor` · `chore` · `docs` · `test` · `perf` · `ci`. No scope prefix.
If a sibling repo uses `type(scope): subject`, keep the difference deliberate and stated here.

Stage and commit by pathspec (`git commit -- <paths>`); `/checkpoint` does too. `git add -A` is
used only inside `/ship`, which states its own guards.

---

## Branching

| Branch                      | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `internal/{scope}`          | Experiments, proof of concept, work on one scope |
| `dev`                       | Active development — all scopes merge here first |
| `prod`                      | Stable, deployed code                            |

Merge order: `internal/{scope}` → `dev` → `prod`. Never push directly to `dev` or `prod`; the
user runs those pushes with `!`.

---

## Protected Files

Never edit without the task explicitly requiring it — see AGENTS.md "Core Files" for why:

```
src/app.ts                  ← composition root; middleware order is a contract (§I Rule 41)
src/env.ts                  ← breaks startup for everyone if the schema is wrong
src/lib/server/factory.ts   ← AppEnv and router creation for every module
src/lib/errors/             ← the error contract: errors.ts, problem.ts, error-codes.ts
src/db/client/index.ts      ← the real connection pool; `{ max: 1 }` here serializes every request
src/db/schema/auth.ts       ← generated by @better-auth/cli
src/db/migrations/          ← drizzle-kit generated — never hand-edited, bar a custom backfill's body (Rule 16)
src/lib/auth/auth.ts        ← better-auth config; breaks every authenticated route
.claude/settings.json
.env* (any)
```

---

## Notes

- `src/modules/<reference-module>/` is the reference module, built to the full layer shape
  (errors, schema, service with injected dependencies, thin handler, route owning the contract,
  tests). Copy it for new modules, not a module the Compliance Status lists as a deviation.
- On merge to `prod`, `strip-ai-on-pr.yml` removes `.claude/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `SSOT.md` from the deployed branch — these files will not exist in `prod`.

---

## On-demand References

Nothing below loads automatically. Read the file when its row matches the task. The shared docs
ship as `.claude/*.example.md`: copy one to its name without `.example`, fill every placeholder,
and delete the ones you do not use along with their rows.

| Read when | File |
| --- | --- |
| Hooks, GitHub and CI, reviews, MCP pins, deploy verification, skill scanning | `.claude/OPERATIONS.md` |
| Known traps — scan the trigger keywords before debugging | `.claude/anti-patterns/INDEX.md` |
| Reviewing a change: the human checklist, keyed to AGENTS.md rules | `.claude/docs/code-review-checklist.md` |
| Postgres through `db-dev`/`db-prod`: topology, tunnel, production rules | `.claude/DATABASE.md` |
| CI runner pools and what they cost | `.claude/CI-RUNNERS.md` |
| The analytics read API | `.claude/ANALYTICS.md` |
| Serena scoping across several repos | `.claude/SERENA-WORKSPACE.md` |
| Rarely used MCP servers, loaded per session with `claude --mcp-config` | `.claude/mcp/*.json` |
| Unlocking `.env` edits or production writes, and what the lock does not stop | `docs/unlock.md` |
