# /resolve-pr-review — PR Review Resolver

## Step 1: Fetch

```bash
gh pr view {PR} --repo {OWNER/REPO} --json title,url,headRefName,additions,deletions,changedFiles
gh api "repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/pulls/{PR}/comments" --paginate
gh api "repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/pulls/{PR}/reviews" --paginate
```

With RTK installed, run the two `gh api` calls as `rtk proxy gh api …`: its rewrite can shorten the
JSON, and every comment's `id` and body is needed. If a reviewer was named, filter to that user. If
there are no comments, say so and stop.

## Step 2: Judge Each Against Project Rules

Cross-check every suggestion against `AGENTS.md`. A reviewer bot does not know this repo's
conventions and is regularly confident and wrong.

- Contradicts a rule → `⚠ Conflicts with Rule {N}`, recommend declining
- Supports a rule → `✓ Aligns with Rule {N}`
- Neither → `—`, judge on merit

## Step 3: Triage Table

| ID | File:Line | Reviewer | Type | Rule | Summary |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

Ask which to apply. Order the accepted ones: security and bugs first, then correctness, then
maintainability.

## Step 4: Apply and Verify

Apply in priority order, then re-run `/check-fix` — all gates must pass.

## Step 5: Reply On Each Thread, Then On The PR

Post the outcome in each inline comment's own thread (its `id` from Step 1), then summarise:

```bash
gh api -X POST "repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/pulls/{PR}/comments/{COMMENT_ID}/replies" \
  -f body="<applied in <sha>, or declined and why>"
gh pr comment {PR} --repo {OWNER/REPO} --body "<what was applied, what was declined, and why>"
```

Reply even when nothing was applied. A declined suggestion needs a stated reason; silence reads
as an oversight and the next reviewer raises it again.
