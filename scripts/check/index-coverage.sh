# Foreign-key index gate (AGENTS.md §H Rule 32).
#
# Postgres creates an index for a PRIMARY KEY but NOT for a REFERENCES column,
# so an unindexed FK turns every join and every ON DELETE CASCADE into a
# sequential scan. This checks that each column carrying `.references(` also
# appears in an `index(`/`uniqueIndex(`/`primaryKey(` declaration in the same
# schema file, or carries a column-level `.unique()` or `.primaryKey()` —
# Postgres implements both constraints with an index, so such a column is
# already covered.
#
# Deliberately a heuristic: it reads the Drizzle schema source, not the
# database. It cannot see an index declared in a different file, and it does
# not judge composite index column order — that is the agents-reviewer agent's job.
# It exists to catch the one mistake that is both common and expensive.
